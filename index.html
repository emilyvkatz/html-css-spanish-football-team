        <p id="p-style"> The Spain national football team represents Spain in men's International
          association football and is controlled by the Royal Spanish Football Federation,
          the governing body for football in Spain. The current head coach is Julen Lopetegui
          after Vicente del Bosque stepped down following Euro 2016.[5] The Spanish side is
          commonly referred to as La Roja ("The Red [One]"), La Furia Roja ("The Red Fury"),
          La Furia Española ("The Spanish Fury") or simply La Furia ("The Fury").Spain became
          a member of FIFA in 1904 even though the Spanish Football Federation was first
          established in 1909. Spain's national Spain's national team debuted in 1920. Since then
          the Spanish national team has participated in a total of 14 of 20 FIFA World Cups and
          9 of 14 UEFA European Championships.

    <h2 id="h2-style">History</h2>
        <p id="p-style">
        The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920,
        with the main objective of finding a team that would represent
        Spain at the Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year.
        Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against
        Denmark, silver medallists at the last two Olympic tournaments.
        The Spanish managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0,
        eventually finishing with the silver medal. Spain qualified for their
        first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and
        losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the
        quarter-finals.

        The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain
        from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and
        the 1950 edition's qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped
        their group to progress to the final round, then finished in fourth place. Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals, which had given them the name of the "underachievers".

    <h2 id="h2-style">Home Stadium</h2>
      <p id="p-style">
        Spain does not have a designated national stadium, and as such,
        major qualifying matches are usually played at the Santiago Bernabéu
        Stadium in Madrid. Other large grounds used include the Vicente Calderón
        Stadium, also in Madrid, and the Mestalla in Valencia. Spain is unbeaten
        in competitive matches played at the Calderón. Some international friendlies
        are played in these larger stadia, as well as the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium
        in Seville.

        Barcelona, the second largest city in Spain has not hosted an international
        match with Spain playing since 2004 (held at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium),
        and the largest stadium in Spain and Europe, the Camp Nou has not hosted an
        international match with Spain playing since 1987.
